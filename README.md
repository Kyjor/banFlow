# banFlow: Kanban and Time Tracking Made Easy
*Beware: this project is in a VERY early state and I would not recommend using it yet for an actual project. You may lose all data.*

This application gives the user a desktop Kanban application that also can track the user's time per task. The goal is to have a project management app for individuals, so that they can keep track of time spent on tasks at a granular level. This is so they don't need to maintain a separate board and excel sheet.
